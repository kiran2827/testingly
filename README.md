

Testing.ly is designed for those Customers who wants to Leverage Testing/Process Automation  but with an ease, ease of operating ,
without much exposed to technicality of the solution/automated test/process.

Let  me talk about this problem in more detail:

Lets say here is a delivery team which develops plenty of automation,but at the same time client also wants to leverage that automation tests/suite.

In an ideal case,delivery team would rather try to replicate the solution and add dependancies in the Customer's system
this would cause a technical learning curve for Customers
and whenever scripts fails, debugging issues in Customer's machine, which is time consuming in nature

To Get Rid of these problem:
Testing.ly is designed and developed in manner that,  you can invoke chat assistant and run your test cases using Natural Language.
Hence it provides , Ease of use , Testing on your fingertips.

Moreover this tool can be used a wrapper on existing automations developed, so you really dont need to redevelop your automation,
just need to map your automation to this chatbot and thats it, you are good to go
And Not only Test Scipts, you can add anything Batch Jobs,Automated Processes etc.


This Chatbot requires more enhancements :

for eg login based system, where those login credentials can used for doing daily activities like (sending emails etc)
If you think of more enhancements ,please feel free to create an issue in Github.


and You can find end to end installation, setup,and user guide in wiki

Thanks :)
